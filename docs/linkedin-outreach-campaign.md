## Outreach Strategy

### Approach 1: Comment Outreach
1. Find posts about "Reddit marketing", "growth hacking", "startup marketing"
2. Leave thoughtful comments
3. DM people who engage

### Approach 2: Connection Request Templates

**Template A (For Startup Founders):**
```
Hi [Name], I noticed you're building [Company] - saw your post about [topic].

We built RedditAutoMarket (https://redditautomarket.com) to help founders get their first 100 users through Reddit - without the manual outreach grind.

Would love to chat about what's working for your growth. Happy to share what we're seeing across 100+ startups.

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Template B (For Agency Owners):**
```
Hi [Name], came across your profile - impressive work with [Company/s].

We're seeing a lot of agencies struggle with Reddit management - it's time-intensive and hard to scale.

RedditAutoMarket lets agencies manage unlimited client accounts with AI-generated comments. Would love to show you a quick demo.

Interested?
```

### Approach 3: Post Content

**Post Template 1:**
```
🔥 Reddit marketing without the grind

I've spent 500+ hours on Reddit for our startup. Here's what actually works:

1. Find posts where you can add value (not just promotional)
2. Comment within 30 min of posting ( algorithms favor early engagement)
3. Follow up with DMs 48 hours later

We built a tool to automate steps 1-2. Would love to share with founders who are tired of manual outreach.

DM me "Reddit" and I'll send you our free guide + early access.
```

**Post Template 2:**
```
Hot take: Reddit is the most underrated growth channel for B2B SaaS

Here's why:
- 52% of users are 18-34 (prime buying age)
- Communities are highly targeted (subreddits = intent)
- Organic reach is still possible (unlike Twitter now)

The problem? It's incredibly time-consuming.

That's why we built RedditAutoMarket - AI-powered Reddit marketing automation.

Anyone using Reddit for B2B lead gen? Would love to compare notes.
